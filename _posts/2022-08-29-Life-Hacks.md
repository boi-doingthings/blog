## Travelling
### Railways
* Use the [IRCTC Reservation Charts](https://www.irctc.co.in/online-charts/) to view available seats within ranges.
* Always save one of your friends or your alternate number with a name like `AD-IRCTCSi`. Thus, you can quickly send up a dummy message that could be helpful in dealing with Ad-Hoc Ticket Checkers. CAUTION: Make sure the person isn't carrying a chart with them or else you are gone.
* Always choose a side upper birth if your are 5'6" or below. Above take the Upper Birth.
